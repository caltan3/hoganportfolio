        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Hogan, a passionate artist and storyteller dedicated to bringing creative visions to life. Ever since I was young, I‚Äôve been fascinated by the power of art in storytelling‚Äîhow simple lines and colors can build entire worlds, evoke emotions, and connect people. That passion led me to embark on my biggest creative endeavor: <strong>The Hollow Frost</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>The Hollow Frost</strong> is a personal passion project that I‚Äôve spent years refining. From world-building to character development, I‚Äôve poured my heart into every aspect of the story, striving to create something that resonates with readers. On <strong>January 3, 2025</strong>, I finally released the first chapter, marking the beginning of what I hope will be a long and exciting journey.</p>

        <h3>My Artistic Journey</h3>
        <p>For the past <strong>four years</strong>, I‚Äôve been an active and dedicated member of the <strong>Hillgrove Art Club</strong>, where I‚Äôve had the opportunity to grow as an artist, collaborate with like-minded creatives, and participate in a variety of art competitions. Some of the notable competitions and projects I‚Äôve taken part in include:</p>

        <p><strong>LiveOn</strong> (2022, 2023, 2024), Earth Day Art Contest, Full Cover Face Masks Design, Art Friend Watercolour Competition at SG River, Fo Guang Shan Art Contest, National Day Poster Design, Acrylic Painting for Speech Day Guest of Honor, and more.</p>

        <h2>Projects & Competitions</h2>
        <p>Beyond competitions, I‚Äôve been actively involved in community-based art projects.

    <section id="dreams">
        <h2>Dreams & Aspirations</h2>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to carve out a successful career while doing something I genuinely enjoy. Right now, I have two big ambitions:</p>

        <p><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Pursuing a Business Course & Making Bank</strong>  
        I want to enter a **business course** alongside my homie and dive deep into the world of entrepreneurship. Business is something that has always intrigued me, and I see it as a path to financial freedom and success. Whether it‚Äôs **marketing, management, or sales**, I‚Äôm ready to learn and build something impactful.</p>

        <p><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative Paths: Architecture or Marketing</strong>  
        If I don‚Äôt manage to get into a business course, I‚Äôll pivot towards **architecture** or **marketing**. Architecture combines creativity with functionality, something I find fascinating. Marketing, on the other hand, aligns well with my artistic skills and ability to engage audiences, making it another strong option for my future.</p>
        <p><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Graphic Design</strong>

        </strong></p>

        <p>No matter which path I take, my goal is simple: **work hard, stay dedicated, and achieve financial success** while enjoying what I do.</p>
